# boyi_convert
 Quick and dirty World Of Goo 2 .image file converter. Converts from `.image` to `.png`.
 ## `.png` to `.image`
 World of Goo 2 can load normal `.png` files, you just need to change their file extension to `.image`. But, for completion's sake I am also working on conversion of `.png` files back to `.image` files and it will hopefully be released soon.
# Usage
## Drag and Drop
On Windows, you can drag and drop `.image` files onto `boyi_convert.exe`.
## CLI
`boyi_convert <input_path> -o <output_path>` (`output_path` is optional)
